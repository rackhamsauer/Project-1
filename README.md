# Project One: Successful Movie Analysis

This is a group project for UC Berkeley's Data Analysis and Visualization bootcamp. By looking at a dataset, we studied various factors in determining possible correlations for critically successful movies.

The research of our analysis came from thinking about movies and questions arising if certain aspects could significantly impact if a movie is more statistically likely to be successful.Specifically, we looked to for trends within genre, audience approval, intended audience, revenue, and directors.

## Installation

The project was written in Python and utilizes Jupyter Notebook with the following dependencies:

```python
  import pandas as pd
  from pathlib import Path
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  import scipy.stats as st
  import seaborn as sns

```
